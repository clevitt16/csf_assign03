MS1

Trisha and Casey both made main.c, Makefile, csimFuncs.c, and csimFuncs.h
In main.c, we are reading and validating the command line inptus, and we are reading the file stream. csimFuncs.c has the beginnings of a helper function to verify that values are powers of 2.  


MS2

Casey wrote powerOfTwo(), computeIndex(), searchCache(), and the bulk of main.c
Trisha implemented the FIFO and LRU and the loads of blocks into cache. Trisha wrote the functions loadToCache(), incrementFIFO(), incrementLRU(), findMaxCounter(), and some of main.c
